/**
 * batchApproveFeatures server action — unit tests.
 *
 * The action is a thin pass-through to `BatchApproveFeaturesUseCase`, the same
 * use case `shep fleet approve` runs. Its whole job is to resolve the use case
 * by token, forward the scope, and turn a thrown container/use-case error into
 * a value the drawer can toast instead of an unhandled rejection.
