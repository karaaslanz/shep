/**
 * Batch approval for the fleet triage drawer (spec 111).
 *
 * Thin server action over `BatchApproveFeaturesUseCase` — the same use case
 * `shep fleet approve` runs — so the web drawer and the CLI can never disagree
 * about what "approve all P1" does. No business logic lives here: the
 * sequential, error-isolated approval loop, the P1/gate filtering and the
 * per-feature failure collection are all the use case's job.
 *
 * The use case is imported as a **type** and resolved by string token, which is
 * the convention every other action in this directory follows (see the note in
 * `fleet-data.ts`): a value import makes Turbopack bundle core's module graph,
 * whose `.js`-suffixed relative imports the Next build cannot resolve.
 *
 * Errors are returned, not thrown. A thrown server-action rejection surfaces in
 * the browser as an opaque digest, and the drawer needs a string it can toast.
