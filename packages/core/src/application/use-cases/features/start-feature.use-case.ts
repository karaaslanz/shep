/**
 * Start Feature Use Case
 *
 * Transitions a Pending feature to its active lifecycle and spawns
 * the agent. Validates lifecycle state, checks the parent dependency
 * gate and the parallel-capacity gate, and reuses the existing AgentRun record.
 *
 * Both gates must be open, and they are evaluated in that order: a feature
 * whose parent has not landed is Blocked and is NOT queued, because queuing it
 * would park a feature that cannot start anyway ahead of one that could.
 *
 * Before the agent is spawned the branch is brought in sync: everything
 * already in the worktree is committed and the branch is rebased onto the
 * latest base branch, so the agent starts from up-to-date code and no
 * pre-existing work is lost. That, and the spawn itself, belong to
 * SpawnFeatureAgentUseCase — the single path from a persisted feature to a
 * running agent.
