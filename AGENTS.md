# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.) working in this repository.

## Project

`@shepai/cli` — Autonomous AI Native SDLC Platform. Users run `shep` in a repo to gather requirements via AI, generate plans, and execute implementation autonomously.

## Spec Workflow

**All feature work MUST begin with `/shep-kit:new-feature`.** See [spec-driven-workflow](./docs/development/spec-driven-workflow.md).

`/shep-kit:new-feature → /shep-kit:research → /shep-kit:plan → /shep-kit:implement → /shep-kit:commit-pr`

Specs live in `specs/NNN-feature-name/`. **Edit YAML only — Markdown is auto-generated.**

## Architecture

Clean Architecture — four layers in `packages/core/src/` (dependencies point inward):

- `domain/` — Core business logic, no external deps
- `application/` — Use cases, output port interfaces
- `infrastructure/` — External concerns: DB, agents, services
- `presentation/` — CLI, TUI, Web UI (`src/presentation/`)

See [clean-architecture](./docs/architecture/clean-architecture.md).

## Mandatory Rules

- **MANDATORY — TDD**: Write failing tests FIRST (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR). Every plan phase must define explicit TDD cycles. See [tdd-guide](./docs/development/tdd-guide.md).
- **MANDATORY — TypeSpec-first**: Domain models defined in `tsp/`. Run `pnpm tsp:compile` to generate `packages/core/src/domain/generated/output.ts`. Never edit generated files. See [typespec-guide](./docs/development/typespec-guide.md).
- **MANDATORY — Agent resolution**: No component may hardcode an agent type. All resolution flows through `IAgentExecutorProvider`. See [agent-system](./docs/architecture/agent-system.md). The supervisor agent (spec 093) follows the same rule — its evaluator LLM is resolved through `IAgentExecutorProvider`, never a hardcoded provider SDK.
- **MANDATORY — Storybook stories**: Every web UI component MUST have a colocated `.stories.tsx` file. Commits without stories will be rejected.
- **MANDATORY — Spec-driven**: All features start with `/shep-kit:new-feature`. No implementation without a spec.
- **MANDATORY — Actor namespaces**: When an agent acts on a user's behalf (e.g., the supervisor closing an approval gate), it MUST use the `supervisor:<id>` actor namespace. The user namespace `user:<id>` always wins on conflict — `ApproveAgentRunUseCase` / `RejectAgentRunUseCase` enforce this invariant. See [supervision](./docs/architecture/supervision.md#user-always-wins-invariant).

## Settings-Driven Agent Resolution (MANDATORY)

**No component may name an agent.** Every LLM call resolves the agent from settings, at call
time, through `IAgentExecutorProvider`:

```ts
// packages/core/src/application/ports/output/agents/agent-executor-provider.interface.ts
export interface IAgentExecutorProvider {
  getExecutor(): Promise<IAgentExecutor>;
}
```

The single implementation reads the user's stored choice and asks the factory for that
executor — nothing else decides:

```ts
// packages/core/src/infrastructure/services/agents/common/agent-executor-provider.service.ts
async getExecutor(): Promise<IAgentExecutor> {
  const settings = await this.settingsRepository.load();
  if (!settings) throw new Error('Settings not found. Please run initialization first.');
  return this.factory.createExecutor(settings.agent.type, settings.agent);
}
```

What this forbids, concretely:

- No `import { ChatAnthropic } from '@langchain/anthropic'` (or any other provider SDK) outside
  an executor in `infrastructure/services/agents/common/executors/`.
- No `if (agentType === AgentType.ClaudeCode)` branch in a use case, node, command or component.
- No agent type captured at construction time and reused later — resolve per call, so
  `shep settings agent` takes effect without a restart.
- LangGraph nodes are **factories that receive an executor** and never choose one. See
  `nodes/analyze.node.ts` and how `createFeatureAgentGraph()` wires them.

The supervisor agent (spec 093) follows the same rule — its evaluator LLM is resolved through
`IAgentExecutorProvider`, never a hardcoded provider SDK.

## Current Implementation

`packages/core/src/domain/shared/agent-catalog.ts` is the **single source of truth** for every
agent fact. It is typed as a total `Record<AgentType, AgentDescriptor>`, so adding a member to
the TypeSpec `AgentType` enum is a **compile error** until its row is filled in — the compiler
produces the "what do I have to touch" list.

| Agent type | Label | Kind | Binary | Tool id | Status |
| ---------- | ----- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `claude-code` | Claude Code | CLI | `claude` | `claude-code` | Supported |
| `kimi-code` | Kimi Code | CLI | `kimi` | `kimi` | Supported |
| `codex-cli` | Codex CLI | CLI | `codex` | `codex` | Supported |
| `copilot-cli` | Copilot CLI | CLI | `copilot` | `copilot` | Supported |
| `cursor` | Cursor CLI | CLI | `cursor-agent` | `cursor-cli` | Supported |
| `gemini-cli` | Gemini CLI | CLI | `gemini` | `gemini-cli` | Supported |
| `cline` | Cline | CLI | `cline` | — | Supported |
| `openrouter` | OpenRouter | SDK | — | — | Supported (API key) |
| `together-ai` | Together AI | SDK | — | — | Supported (API key) |
| `ollama` | Ollama | SDK | — | — | Supported |
| `llmproxy` | LLM Proxy | SDK | — | — | Supported |
| `dev` | Demo | mock | — | — | Supported |
| `aider` | Aider | — | — | — | **Coming soon** — no executor |
| `continue` | Continue | — | — | — | **Coming soon** — no executor |

Two traps the catalog exists to stop repeating: Cursor's binary is **`cursor-agent`**, not
`cursor`; and `toolId` MUST equal the basename of the JSON file under
`infrastructure/services/tool-installer/tools/`, because that is how tool ids are derived.

Executors live in `packages/core/src/infrastructure/services/agents/common/executors/`
(one file per agent, plus `ai-sdk-base-executor.service.ts` for the HTTP/SDK agents and
`process-stream.ts` for NDJSON CLI plumbing). `AgentExecutorFactory` derives its supported set
from the catalog, so the picker and the factory cannot disagree.

## Commit Format

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

| Types | feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert |
| Scopes | specs, shep-kit, cli, tui, web, api, domain, agents, deployment, tsp, deps, config, dx, release, ci |

The scope is **optional** — commitlint reports an unknown scope as a warning (severity 1) and
`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml` sets `requireScope: false`. Subject **case is not enforced**
(`'subject-case': [0]` in `commitlint.config.mjs`); keep it under 72 characters with no trailing
period. Note `docs` and `build` are *types*, never scopes.

## Supervisor Agent (spec 093)

A delegated **supervisor agent** can monitor approval gates and agent questions on
behalf of the user. The whole surface is gated behind the `collaboration` feature flag.

| Concept | Where |
|---|---|
| `SupervisorPolicy` (config) | `tsp/agents/supervisor-policy.tsp` → `supervisor_policies` table |
| `SupervisorDecision` (audit) | `tsp/agents/supervisor-decision.tsp` → `supervisor_decisions` + `activity_log` |
| `ISupervisorAgent` port | `packages/core/src/application/ports/output/agents/supervisor-agent.interface.ts` |
| Evaluator workflow | `packages/core/src/infrastructure/services/agents/supervisor-agent/supervisor-graph.ts` |
| Per-scope worker | `packages/core/src/infrastructure/services/agents/supervisor-agent/supervisor-agent-worker.ts` |

Policy resolution is **feature-first then app-fallback**, matching every other
scoped concept in Shep.

### Autonomy ladder

| Level | Supervisor authority | User role |
|---|---|---|
| `advisory` *(default)* | recommend (`advise` / `escalate`) | always acts on every gate |
| `cosign` | approve / reject pre-vote | also approves before gate passes |
| `autonomous` | closes gates via the existing approve/reject use cases with `actor = supervisor:<id>` | optional override at any time |

### `supervisor:<id>` actor namespace

When the supervisor closes a gate, it invokes the existing
`ApproveAgentRunUseCase` / `RejectAgentRunUseCase` with `actor.namespace =
"supervisor:<id>"`. Both use cases enforce the **"user always wins"** invariant:
if a prior `user:<id>` decision exists for the same gate, the supervisor's call
is refused and the rejection is recorded.

This keeps the existing `waiting_approval` state machine as the single source of
truth — no new pause primitive was invented.

### Unified question pipeline

`AgentQuestion` (`tsp/agents/agent-question.tsp`, table `agent_questions`) is
the single inbox that bridges:

- The Claude Code SDK V2 `canUseTool` interception of `AskUserQuestion` in
  `claude-code-interactive-executor.service.ts` (interactive mode), and
- The parallel `AgentQuestion` of `kind = blocking` emitted by
  `feature-agent-worker.ts` whenever a run hits `waiting_approval`
  (background mode).

Both modes converge on `AnswerAgentQuestionUseCase`. See
[docs/architecture/supervision.md](./docs/architecture/supervision.md) for the
full design and sequence diagrams.

## General
### 1. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `LESSONS.md` (project root) with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project
- Keep lessons short and concise

### 2. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it
